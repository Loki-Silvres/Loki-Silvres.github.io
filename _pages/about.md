I am a researcher focused on **Robotic Perception and Computer Vision**. My work centers on vision-based models applied to swarm mobile robots and autonomous vehicles, aiming to create adaptive robotic platforms that integrate advanced perception, learning, and control mechanisms. My goal is to advance robot intelligence through vision transformers and machine learning techniques that enable autonomous decision-making in dynamic environments. 

I am currently an **CS undergraduate** at **IIT Dhanbad**, India, where I have had the pleasure of working under the mentorship of [Prof. Subhrangsu Mandal](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=4Uc5kc0AAAAJ&hl=en). I was also fortunate to complete an internship at Clutterbot Technologies Pvt. Ltd. in Bangalore, India, where I worked on improving baseline vision models through knowledge distillation and data engineering.
